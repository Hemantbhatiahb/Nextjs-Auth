### Features 
- **User Registration**: Users can easily register by providing their email and a strong password. Upon registration, a verification email is sent to the provided email address to confirm its authenticity.
- **Email Verification**: Ensuring that only valid email addresses are used for registration is essential for security. Users receive a verification link in their email, which, when clicked, verifies their email address and activates their account.
- **User Login**: Registered users can securely login with their verified email and password, gaining access to the application's features and content.
- **Password Reset**: In case of a forgotten password, users can initiate a password reset process. An email containing a password reset link is sent to the registered email address, allowing users to set a new password securely.
